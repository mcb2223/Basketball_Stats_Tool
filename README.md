# Basketball Stats Tool

## The Goals
  - To take a list of data (in this case basketball players) and turn it into a list of balanced teams in an easy to read application.
  - To learn the practice of iterating through and cleaning data without needing modification, then presenting it in a ledgable way.
  -  Practice dictionaries, sets, lists, and all of the other groupings that confuse me.


## Methodology
  - I first moved the criteria for the project into an excel spreadsheet that i could easily read and have up on my second monitor when working.
  - I got a refresher on Dunder Main, including the incredibly helpful workshop through Treehouse.
    - Where this was number two on the criteria, i want to make sure i had an understanding of what this actually did.
  - Pulled up the code from cleaning data challange that we did right before the project came up, so i could rewrite manipulate that to meet what i needed.



## Reflections
  - This project was exponetially harder for me than the number guessing game.
  - I really struggled with the sets and dictionaries trainings so i found myself frequently referencing the materials and cheat sheets.
  - This project felt much more prescribed than the number guessing game.
    - The guessing game there felt like there was a lot of opportunity for creative freedom and experimentation.
    - I was able to reference my guessing game to help me build the interactive part of this project.
  - This helped me get a lot more used to using MS Studio Code.
    - The best feature of using the IDE how i have it set up is when you enter a variable wrong it immediately shows that it is not matching up with any variables or functions.
  - This project was proof you need to just take little bites of the project and put it together. 
    - This was a little harder to run the small bites so there was a lot of building before i could truely run something.
    - Once i would get some of the code written, i threw some dummy values where i knew i could get away with it, just to make sure everything up to that point worked.
  - I made a lot of dumb miststakes in the process of writing this code. I was often forgetting parens when writing and would end up chasing my tail trying to figure out what was wrong, just for me to realize i forgot a paren.
  - I found it very useful to write the functions very small and basic, then once it worked combine several together.
    - This is how i did the player stats, i initially had it broken into several functions, then once i liked the formatting and how it worked i put them all into one.
  - The quit() method is extremely useful for getting the code to end when using stacked funtions like this.  
    - I do see how it will not fit in all code that you need to loop through or maybe jump back a level, but where i had several points where i needed to fully quit, this function was incredibly efficient.
