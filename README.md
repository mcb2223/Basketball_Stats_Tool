# Basketball_Stats_Tool

## The Goals
  - To take a list of data (in this case basketball players) and turn it into a list of balanced teams in an easy to read application.
  - To learn the practice of iterating through and cleaning data without needing modification, then presenting it in a ledgable way.



## My background and how it helped me in this project.
Prior to this course i had no formal training in any form of coding, but in my role i do a lot of reporting and manipulating data. 
I mainly work out of excel and have always dreaded learning VBA but been intriqued with coding in general.
Something stylistic of any report i write is the ability to seperate, modify, and splice back together with (often complex) formulation in one formula. 
In the process of being self taught in complex formulation i became really good at taking something (formulation, vba, etc.) and being able to manipulate it to meet my purpose.
The above was helpful when making this application because the teachers of Techdegree so far have been giving us code that closely resembles what we need for the projects, and once you know the difference between your source code and what you need it to do the modification is easy. 
The other very useful skill i was able to utilize was in lines like "player["guardians"].replace(" and ", ", ")" this is a common technique i use in excel when I am reorganizing data, it is obviously written differently and i had to tap into my notes to remember the syntax.

## Methodology
  - I first moved the criteria for the project into an excel spreadsheet that i could easily read and have up on my second monitor when working.
  - I got a refresher on Dunder Main, including googling some examples.
    - Where this was number two on the criteria, i want to make sure i had an understanding of what this actually did.
  - Pulled up the code from cleaning data challange that we did right before the project came up, so i could rewrite manipulate that to meet what i needed.



## Reflections
  - This project was exponetially harder for me than the number guessing game.
  - The sets and dictionaries trainings we received for me were hard to follow so i found myself frequently referencing the materials and cheat sheets.
    - It would be nice to see an intermediate project in these modules the way Craig Dennis does the grocery list application at the end of introducing lists.
    - That project really helped me with learning to pick apart these projects and adding more complexity in more systematic manner.
  - This project felt much more constricted than the number guessing game.
    - The guessing game there was a lot of opportunity for creative freedom and experimentation, but this telt more prescripted.
