# Basketball_Stats_Tool

## The Goals
  - To take a list of data (in this case basketball players) and turn it into a list of balanced teams in an easy to read application.
  - To learn the practice of iterating through and cleaning data without needing modification.



## My background and how it helped me in this project.
Prior to this course i had no formal training in any form of coding, but in my role i do a lot of reporting and manipulating data. 
I mainly work out of excel and have always dreaded learning VBA but been intriqued with coding in general.
Something stylistic of any report i write is the ability to seperate, modify, and splice back together with (often complex) formulation in one formula. 
In the process of being self taught in complex formulation i became really good at taking something (formulation, vba, etc.) and being able to manipulate it to meet my purpose.
The above was helpful when making this application because the teachers of Techdegree so far have been giving us code that closely resembles what we need for the projects, and once you know the difference between your source code and what you need it to do the modification is easy. 
The other very useful skill i was able to utilize was in lines like "player["guardians"].replace(" and ", ", ")" this is a common technique i use in excel when I am reorganizing data, it is obviously written differently and i had to tap into my notes to remember the syntax.
